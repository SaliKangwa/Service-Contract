This image shows the data captured for contract renewal requests, with a focus on the Contract Number of the expired contract. Upon approval, the new contract is systematically linked to the expired one using this contract number. The Currency field similarly pulls available currencies from the companyâ€™s ERP system, converting them to USD to standardize the approval workflow based on cost and assigned approval limits. <br/>
